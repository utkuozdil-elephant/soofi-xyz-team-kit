# soofi-xyz plugin kit

A [Cursor plugin](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins), [GitHub Copilot CLI plugin](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-creating), and OpenAI Codex plugin packaging company-wide project subagents and skills for AI-assisted development.

## Install

### Cursor

Clone this repository into Cursor's local plugins directory so it is auto-discovered as `soofi-xyz-team-kit`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local
git clone https://github.com/soofi-xyz/cursor-plugin.git ~/.cursor/plugins/local/soofi-xyz-team-kit
```

Then reload Cursor. The plugin will load from `~/.cursor/plugins/local/soofi-xyz-team-kit` and register all agents, skills, and the bundled **`elephant`** MCP server (`mcp.json`) automatically.

**Donphan / Elephant MCP:** Requires Node **22.18+**. Bundled `mcp.json` still runs the current Elephant MCP server with the legacy per-county maps so Donphan keeps working during the Atlas transition. The MCP 2.0 configuration (global Atlas index + gateway order, `npx -y @elephant-xyz/mcp@2 mcp`) is in [`docs/mcp-atlas.example.json`](./docs/mcp-atlas.example.json); switch `mcp.json` to it when MCP 2.0 is released **and** the Atlas index lists at least one county. After install or `git pull`, reload Cursor and confirm **`elephant`** is enabled under **Settings → MCP**. On 2.0, discover scope with `listAtlasCounties`, then pass `state`, `county`, and `dataGroup` explicitly.

**Elephant routing:** `donphan` + `use-elephant-mcp` = explore synchronized Atlas data via normalized MCP 2.0 tools; `oracle` + `use-oracle` = mine county sources, reconcile the internal Query DB, publish one CAR and normalized table set per data group, register the county in Atlas, and verify the global Atlas IPNS; `build-county-transform` = author and prove county transforms; `watchog` + `build-elephant-hero-facts` = build the scheduled homepage hero-facts service. The Query DB is internal and is not the MCP/publication source.

**Self-contained ingestion runtime:** `oracle` drives a fully bundled, self-contained ingestion
runtime at `skills/use-oracle/runtime/` (Node **22.18+**, `npm ci && npm test` there). It never
requires a sibling `oracle-node`, `Counties-trasform-scripts`, or `elephant-query-db` checkout,
and never runs `npx skills add`. See
[`skills/use-oracle/reference/self-contained-ingestion.md`](./skills/use-oracle/reference/self-contained-ingestion.md)
for install, offline replay, bounded live pilot, internal reconciliation artifacts, Atlas
publication handoff, and MCP smoke commands, and run `python3 scripts/check-plugin-clean-room.py`
before opening a PR that touches it.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Add the marketplace first, then install the plugin from that marketplace:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add soofi-xyz/cursor-plugin
copilot plugin install soofi-xyz-team-kit@soofi-xyz
```

### OpenAI Codex

From this checkout, add the repo marketplace and install the Codex plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ./
codex plugin add soofi-xyz-team-kit@soofi-xyz-team-kit
```

The Codex plugin packages the skills in `skills/`. Project-scoped Codex custom agents are materialized in `.codex/agents/` when you work in this repository.

## Update Or Remove

### Cursor

Pull the latest agents and skills from the same directory:

```bash
git -C ~/.cursor/plugins/local/soofi-xyz-team-kit pull
```

Reload Cursor after pulling so updated agents, skills, MCP config, and the manifest are picked up.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

When you are inside the plugin in GitHub Copilot CLI, update it with the plugin-qualified slash command:

```text
/plugin update soofi-xyz-team-kit@soofi-xyz
```

Uninstall the plugin by name:

```bash
copilot plugin uninstall soofi-xyz-team-kit
```

### OpenAI Codex

Refresh the marketplace and reinstall from a new Codex thread:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade soofi-xyz-team-kit
codex plugin add soofi-xyz-team-kit@soofi-xyz-team-kit
```

Remove the installed Codex plugin by name:

```bash
codex plugin remove soofi-xyz-team-kit
```

## Quick start

When in doubt, **start with [`arceus`](./agents/arceus.md)** — the master router. Arceus reads this README, the agent definitions, and the skill metadata, then tells you which specialist(s) and skill(s) to use for your task. It does not perform the work itself; it hands you a copy-pasteable invocation hint for the right agent.

In Cursor, invoke it explicitly with the slash form:

```text
/arceus I need to add Google Tag Manager to a Vite app and want regression coverage
```

Or mention it naturally in chat:

```text
Use the arceus subagent to recommend the right specialist for migrating an SMS template inventory.
```

In GitHub Copilot CLI, select the custom agent with `/agent` and choose `soofi-xyz-team-kit:arceus`, or start directly with `--agent soofi-xyz-team-kit:arceus`.

In Codex, start a new thread from this repository and ask Codex to spawn the `arceus` custom agent:

```text
Spawn the arceus custom agent to recommend the right specialist for migrating an SMS template inventory.
```

Cursor's Agent can also delegate to `arceus` automatically at the start of a task when no specific specialist has been named — so simply describing your task in plain English usually triggers the right routing.

If you already know which specialist you need, skip the router and call them directly — for example `/sylveon` in Cursor, `soofi-xyz-team-kit:sylveon` in Copilot, or "spawn the `sylveon` custom agent" in Codex for Figma-to-code work. The full roster, with triggers and descriptions, lives in the [Agents](#agents) and [Skills](#skills) tables below.

## Agents

**Data product routing:** `lapras` + `build-connect-product` owns Connect, the only
layer that talks to external systems (partner APIs, webhooks, SFTP, Azure Blob,
partner S3 and drop zones), built from generic verbs over typed connections and
compiled to Step Functions. It builds on the Connect service runtime in
`build-connect-service`; `conkeldurr` keeps the integrate-vs-provision decision for
that deployment. `wingull` + `operate-connect-configurations` operates it: onboards
partner exchanges as configuration, proves them on the dev stack and hands them to the product.
`kecleon` + `build-transform-product` owns Transform
(registered `from`/`to` data languages → Lexicon SQL on PySpark → tabular or graph
output, with Parquet/JSONL/CSV encodings and explicit graph ID/endpoint mappings).
Use `conkeldurr` for Lexicon,
Persist loading and the separate Translate service; use `gallade` for Filter
evaluation over persisted facts. Elephant county transforms remain with `oracle`.
`zygarde` + `build-system-product` owns System composition (business outcomes as
Product configuration — schemas, flow templates, flows, waterfall — composing
Lexicon/Connect/Transform/Persist; aligned with StaircaseAPI/product; does not
reimplement Product or leaf engines).
