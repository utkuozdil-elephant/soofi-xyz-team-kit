# Product publish readiness

Use this when a user wants to publish a product to Prism Marketplace and has no
`bundle_url` yet. First inspect the product repository and report the gaps
(section C). When the user asks, make the repository changes on a new branch and
open a pull request (section D). Never push to the default branch.

Reference implementation: [Spring-Oaks-Capital-LLC/deploy#3](https://github.com/Spring-Oaks-Capital-LLC/deploy/pull/3)
("Make Deploy Marketplace-publishable"). Reuse its manifest shape and
`scripts/pack-cloud-assembly.ts` instead of inventing a new layout.

Marketplace's own checks live in `prismteam-ai/marketplace`
`lambda/services/bundle-review.ts` (`inspectBundle`, `assertComplyPassed`,
`assertCloudAssemblyZip`). They win if this list drifts. Re-read them before
changing a product.

## A. Repository requirements

Check each item in the product repo at its default branch.

1. **`marketplace.product.json` at the repo root.** Declarative only.

   ```json
   {
     "component_id": "deploy",
     "component_name": "Deploy",
     "bundle_type": "SERVICE",
     "context_schema_version": "1",
     "stacks": ["deploy-data", "deploy-workflow", "deploy-api"],
     "base_path": "deploy",
     "requires": { "domain": false, "shared_usage_plan": false, "identity": false }
   }
   ```

   - `component_id` must equal the Marketplace component id it will publish to.
   - `bundle_type` is `SERVICE` or `DATA`.
   - `stacks[]` must equal the CDK construct ids in the app entrypoint.
   - Must NOT contain `entrypoint` in the packed copy, or any command or
     lifecycle field (`synth_command`, `deploy_command`, `post_deploy_command`,
     `build_command`, `scripts`, `docker_build`, `serverless`, `terraform`,
     `sam`, `pulumi`, `engine`).

   Incorrect — a command field Marketplace and Deploy reject:

   ```json
   { "component_id": "connect", "bundle_type": "SERVICE", "stacks": ["connect-api"], "deploy_command": "cdk deploy" }
   ```

2. **TypeScript CDK app with stage-neutral construct ids.** The construct id
   stays fixed (`deploy-api`, `Connect`); only `stackName` carries the stage
   (`deploy-${stage}-api`, `Connect-${stage}`), so existing installs update in
   place. `cdk synth --strict` must succeed. No Serverless Framework, SAM, or
   Terraform deploy path.

   Incorrect — the construct id changes per stage, so `stacks[]` cannot match:

   ```ts
   new ConnectStack(app, `Connect-${stage}`, { stage });
   ```

   Correct:

   ```ts
   new ConnectStack(app, "Connect", { stage, stackName: `Connect-${stage}` });
   ```

3. **Lambda bundles minified with no source maps.** Set these in the product's
   single Lambda bundling helper, not per function:

   ```ts
   bundling: { minify: true, sourceMap: false, sourcesContent: false /* ...existing */ }
   ```

   No `.map` or `.ts` files may appear in staged assets. The Build service's
   `@internal/marketplace-cdk` import rule does not apply when Build is not in
   the pipeline; do not add that package or a stub import.
4. **No Docker image assets.** File assets only in `cdk.out/*.assets.json`.
5. **A pack step** (`just pack`, backed by `scripts/pack-cloud-assembly.ts`)
   that zips only:

   ```text
   marketplace.product.json
   build/build.manifest.json
   cdk.out/manifest.json
   cdk.out/<Stack>.template.json   # each with a Resources object
   cdk.out/*.assets.json and asset.* dirs
   ```

   and never `lib/`, `src/`, `lambda/`, `test/`, `node_modules/`,
   `marketplace/app.ts`, `.git/`, or env files. Under 256 MiB, non-ZIP64.
6. **A publish step** (`just publish`) that packs, uploads to S3 with metadata
   (section B), and prints a presigned URL (section B2).
7. **Tests** covering the manifest, stack ids, and zip layout.

## B. Metadata Marketplace reads from the S3 object

- `bundle_url` is an Amazon S3 HTTPS object URL, reachable without redirects,
  with `Content-Length`.
- `x-amz-meta-service-builder` decodes to an object with
  `artifact_kind: "CDK_CLOUD_ASSEMBLY"`, `deployer_contract_version: "1"`,
  `component_id` matching the Marketplace component, `sha256:` values for
  `source_hash` / `assembly_hash` / `artifact_hash` (artifact hash must match
  the zip bytes), a `cloud_assembly` object, a `deployment_parameters` object,
  and a `lambda_asset_policy` object.
- `x-amz-meta-service-comply` decodes to an object with a `severity_label`
  below `MEDIUM`.

Encoding: an unsigned token `<base64url header>.<base64url JSON payload>.`;
Marketplace reads the middle segment. S3 limits all user metadata on an object
to 2 KB, so keep both payloads compact (no per-asset hash maps).

Who writes it:

- **`service-builder`**: when Build is not in the pipeline, the product's own
  publish step writes it. Set `issuer` to the product pipeline (for example
  `connect/just-publish`), never to the Build service. Compute every hash from
  real bytes.
- **`lambda_asset_policy`**: write the true values. Marketplace currently
  requires `obfuscated: true`; if the product does not obfuscate, do not write
  `true` — report that Marketplace must drop the requirement or an obfuscation
  step must be added.
- **`service-comply`**: only from a scan that actually ran. Never write a
  passing verdict by hand. If no scan exists, report that Marketplace must
  accept bundles without Comply metadata before this product can publish.

## B2. Host the bundle and get the presigned URL

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=<selected-profile> AWS_REGION=<region>
BUCKET=<product-artifacts-bucket>
KEY=bundles/<component_id>/<component_id>-cloud-assembly.zip

TARGET_ENV=<stage> just pack

aws s3 cp artifacts/<component_id>-cloud-assembly.zip "s3://$BUCKET/$KEY" \
  --content-type application/zip \
  --metadata "service-builder=$BUILDER_TOKEN,service-comply=$COMPLY_TOKEN"

aws s3 presign "s3://$BUCKET/$KEY" --expires-in 7200
```

- Set metadata at upload time; S3 cannot add it to an existing object.
- Use an expiry that outlasts the review (Marketplace re-downloads after up to
  ~7.5 minutes of sandbox polling). SSO sessions cap the URL lifetime.
- The URL must be a plain Amazon S3 HTTPS object URL, not CloudFront.
- Treat the presigned URL as a secret while it is valid. Do not commit it.
- Pack with credentials for the install account when the app pins
  `env.account` at synth time.

Run upload or presign commands only when the user asks, after they confirm AWS
credentials are ready and name the bucket, account, and region.

## C. How to report

Return a table with one row per item in A and B: `ready`, `missing`, or
`cannot verify`, with the file path or evidence. List the concrete change for
each `missing` row, citing Deploy PR #3. End with whether the product can
publish now, and which blockers are outside the product repo (Marketplace
Comply or obfuscation requirement, missing sandbox Deploy).

## D. Make the product publishable (only when the user asks)

1. Confirm the target repository and that the user wants a pull request.
2. Create a branch `feat/marketplace-publishable` from the default branch.
3. Implement every `missing` item from A: manifest, stage-neutral construct id
   (update tests that construct the stack), bundling flags, pack script adapted
   from Deploy's (map construct id to the stage `stackName`), publish target,
   and tests. Match the repo's package manager, test runner, and style.
4. Run the repo's own checks (format, lint, type-check, tests, `cdk synth`) and
   the pack step locally. Fix failures before opening the PR.
5. Open the pull request. In the description, list what changed, the check
   results, and any blocker outside the repo from section B.
6. Do not deploy, upload, or publish as part of this lane. Do not merge.
